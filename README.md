# Personal Profile Streamlit App --> WORK IN PROGRESS

This is my personal profile/portfolio app, designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Pharmacist and Data Scientist. It is built using Streamlit and includes sections for projects, services, CV, and more. The app also includes a chatbot trained on my professional data.

## How to Run

Just visit https://asuaje-data-scientist-portfolio.streamlit.app/

Alternatively:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your_streamlit_profile.git

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
