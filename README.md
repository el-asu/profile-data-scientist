# Personal Profile Streamlit App

This is my personal profile/portfolio app, designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Pharmacist and Data Scientist. It is built using Streamlit and includes sections for projects, services, CV, and more. The app also includes a chatbot trained on my professional data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your_streamlit_profile.git
    cd your_streamlit_profile
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main script for the Streamlit app.
- `assets/`: Contains images and media files.
- `data/`: Stores the CV PDF and other important files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the app.

## To Do:
- Replace the placeholder images in the `assets/` folder with your own.
- Add the actual CV PDF in the `data/` folder.
- Integrate the Llama chatbot with your professional data.
